# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles. I only use the Python standard library, and I require that the code follows the [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) recommendations. Furthermore, everything should be type annotated, and code must have 100% test coverage.
